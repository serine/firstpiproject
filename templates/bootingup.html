<h3>Lets Boot Up your Raspberry Pi!</h3>

<p>
 You are almost there! So have got your first Raspberry Pi. You have taken it out of the box and it look
 great. You have got your case asssembled and all pirepheries are connected and you are keen to turn it
 on. Well, go right ahead and turn it on by simply pluging it into power socket. 
 <br>
 <br>
 You will see text running up the screen - Yes, Raspberry Pi is alive ! What you see on the screen is
 <a href="learninglinux/cliinto">CLI</a>. Now you will understand why there was all this talk about Linux
 and <a href="learninglinux/cliinto">CLI</a> before hand.
 <br> 
 <br> 
 You will see at the bottom of the screen login prompt <span id="white">raspberrypi login:</span> and you
 will need to login into your Raspberry Pi
</p>

 <ul>
     <li> <span id="white">user: pi</span></li>
     <li> <span id="white">password: raspberry</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
 <span id="note">Note: when you are going to type in the password there will be nothing appering on the
  scree. This is Linux feature preventing people looking over your shoulder and at least seeing how long
  your password is.</span>
</p>
<br>
<p id="prompt">
 Once you have logged in you should see command-line prompt like this <span id="green">
 pi@raspberrypi<span id="blue"> ~ $</span></span>. Your prompt will change depending where abouts in the
 file system you are. Your prompt will change everytime you change directories <b>e.g</b> if you change
 into <span id="white">python_games/</span> directory by typing <span id="white">cd python_games/</span>
 and press enter, your promopt will now look like this
 <span id="green">pi@raspberrypi<span id="blue"> ~ /python_games $ </span></span>. 
</p>

<p>
 I want to share with you much more, but we will pause this discussion for now and move on to more
 exciting stuff, something that you have been waiting for a while now - Lets play some games!!
