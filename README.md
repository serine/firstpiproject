--------------

The name "First Raspberry Pi Project" might be a little misleading to some since it is about getting
your first Raspberry Pi, setting it all up, booting it up and taking it further in any direction you
would want.
<br>
At this stage the website catered towards my 11 years old nephew, who spends all his time (as far as I concern)
playing Minecraft or Nintendo 3DS. I thought to try to divert him into better time waste e.g Linux, Python, BASH
whatever, but where he will hopefully start learning a bit more about computers and they use I suppose.
Raspberry Pi B+ model at least comes with Minecraft Pi edition installed on it. I thought to use that as a bait to 
get interested in setting up Raspberry Pi and on the backhand of that teach him a little bit about Linux, CLI and maybe 
take it further into programming, maybe with Python. 
<br>
All in all this website is gentel step by step introduction to Raspberry Pi setting up and with ample of links to the
official Raspberry Pi website as a main source of information. 

The Latest Version
------------------

This website in daily development. Depending on how well it will be taken up by my nephew I might add extra features to
it. 
<br>
I really would like to make it any device friendly and am working on responsive web design. At this stage the website
is only usable on the desktops.
