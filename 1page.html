There are a couple of things you will need to do before you can enjoy Minecraft Pi
             edition.
            <br> 
            
            <h4>Here is a list of items that you will need for your Raspberry Pi set up</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 x HDMI cable</li>
                <li>1 x USB cable</li>
                <li>1 x USB charger 5V DC and 1500-2000mA
                (you might want ask your dad about this)</li>
                <li>1 x micro SD card class 10, minimum 8G</li>
            </ul>

 Once you have got your raspberry pi, go ahead and put together case for raspberry pi. I have provided for you here. Once you have fitted for raspberry pi into it's case you can start connecting all the peripheries. I provided details here.

Your raspberry pi needs some additional items. Check that you have them all before proceeding.

Once you have got all of the items, connect them all up to your raspberry pi.
Okay here comes the hardest part about your raspberry pi. In order to operate your raspberry pi you need to know Linux.

What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system, just like Windows. To be perfectly correct Linux actually is the kernel and every modern operating systems would have a kernel as a heart of its system. (You can read more about different types of operating systems here link to Wikipedia). Despite Linux that important remake about Linux is kernel, it is very very common to call any operating systems that uses Linux kernel, simply Linux operating system or Linux for short. However there are many different Linux based operating systems they are called distributions. Probably by far most common once are Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian, Fedora and openSUSE, but there are really hundreds of different Linux distributions. And by the way not every Linux distribution has to be a fully functioning operating system, those mentioned above are dedicatedly full operating systems alike Windows 7 or 8 OR alike Macintosh OS X. Linux distributions can be just a firmware for a modern or a router.

We are going to use Raspbian Linux distribution, which is optimised Debian distribution for raspberry pi hardware.
I have already pre installed raspbian on your micro SD card. All you have to do is too insert it into your raspberry pi. Here is the link to official documentations on how to burn raspbian to SD card. Once everything is connected you can go ahead and bout your raspberry pi for the first time by simply turning on the power supply.

Here is how it looks like "image"

What dose it all means and why my mouse isn't working??

Now I need to introduce you to another new concept command line. What you see is a


Other examples of Unix/Linux derived systems:
in fact both Macintosh (developed and owned by Apple) and Android (developed by Google) are two very good example of Linux based operating systems.

I have also provided a short specification summary below.
            <p>
            <h4>Raspberry Pi B+ model specifications:</h4>
            <ul>
